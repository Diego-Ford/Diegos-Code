This Document will demonstrate a basic R markdown file. You can make *italic* and **bold** words.
In this Document we will make a time series graph for the *airmiles* data from R. 
This data has two variables:

* **Date**
* **Miles Flown**
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

## Load Data

```{r airmiles data}
data(airmiles)
```

## Plot Air Miles

```{r pressure}
plot(airmiles)
```


## Analysis 

This data is very interesting, the average miles flown over the years listed is `r mean(airmiles)` miles! thats **alot** of miles! and it goes up and up.the equation to find average is $$ sum(x) / nrow(x) $$, now you can see how the math is done! it was very ~~tedious~~ easy and fun to create this basic interactive markdown file!
